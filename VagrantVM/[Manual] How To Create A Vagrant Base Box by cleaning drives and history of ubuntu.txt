This tutorial will create a base box using Ubuntu 16.04

1. First, initialize vagrant, ssh into the box and install whatever you want on it.

While still in ssh…

You can also use this tutorial and script to initialize and install a lemp stack:

2. Make the box as small as possible

$ sudo apt-get clean
3. Then, “zero out” the drive

Not sure what this does

$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M
$ sudo rm -f /EMPTY
4. Clear the Bash History and exit the VM

$ cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit
Now continue from the vagrant command line
5. Repackage the server we just created into a new vagrant base box

where ‘mynew.box' is any name you choose while adding .box at the end

$ vagrant package --output mynew.box
6. Add this new Vagrant Box into Vagrant

where ‘mynewbox' is any name you choose (preferrably similar to the name of the box you just added) and ‘mynew.box' is the file name of the box you just created

$ vagrant box add mynewbox mynew.box
This now will “download” the box into your Vagrant installation allowing you to initiate this from any folder.
