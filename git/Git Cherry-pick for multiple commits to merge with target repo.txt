You can use

git cherry-pick <commit id>

to pick specific commits

To close the cycle and make a PR from master. We can do the following steps:

Assume being on the master branch:

git checkout -b myNewBranch // this will create a new branch named myNewBranch
git cherry-pick <commitID 1> // this will take the commit with the commit ID 1 and 
                             // attempt to place it on top of the master branch. 
                             // Note however, there might be conflicts to resolve
git cherry-pick <commitID 2> // this will take the commit with the commit ID 2 and place on top of the master branch
git push origin/<some branch name> // will push the changes to remote. Usually origin/<local branch name>
Then you can make a pull request depending on your platform. So it can be from the GUI. Be it on a GitHub platform or DevAzure, etc. In your case via BitBucket GUI.

Side note: the steps above are made for simplicity. It is also possible to make the cherry-pick with one line. Like so:

git cherry-pick <commitID 1> <commitID 2>


==========
Cherry picking is not supported in the UI but it is easy to accomplish on the command line or using a tool like SourceTree.

You could do something roughly like this:

git checkout DEV
git log

# copy the commit hash

git checkout SIT
git cherry-pick <commit_hash_from_DEV>

# now that commit from DEV is in SIT (assuming there are no conflicts)
Here is some additional documentation: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick
=======================

Fork original-repo as "your-repo"

git clone your-repo
cd your-repo
git checkout dev
git pull //to get all your commits to local
git checkout master
git pull //to make sure branch is upto date
git cherry-pick commit-id
git push //commits the cherry-picked commits to the master branch of forked repo

Raise PR from Forked repo "your-repo" master branch to "original-repo" master branch
