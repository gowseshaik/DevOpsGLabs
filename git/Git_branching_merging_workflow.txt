My preferred branching workflow
I like to use a branching workflow like this:

Create a feature branch off master
Build the feature
Create a PR for that branch
Merge and deploy
Delete the feature branch
That’s it! No need for a “branching model” that takes a lengthy blog post to explain. Just make a branch, merge the branch, then delete the branch. It’s very similar to GitHub’s Git workflow.
