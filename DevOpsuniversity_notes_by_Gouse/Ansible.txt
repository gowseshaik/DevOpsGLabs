Ansible -Controller(Master), its will communicate with SSH protocol authentication of user authentication
        Ansible is python based protocol
        it follows PUSH method.
        it reads the data from yaml.
        its an agentless tool.
        Ansible controller will hit a command at one place and control every where and everything.
        Ansible controller control all Managed -Nodes
Ansible cannot be installed on windows machine, but manage windows machine.

starting/stopping -- are called operational changes
changing/modifying in tools -- called configurational changes.

process of configuration:
  Configuration identification
  Configuration Control

Why Ansible:
  Change management
  Provisioning
  Orchestration
  Automation
  IDEMPOTENCE
  IDEMPOTENCE : A Function is idempotent if repeated applications has the same affect as a single appliction.
  shell script will not have inteligncy,
  But ansible is inteligncy, it is having IDEMPOTENCEY.
  Simple
  Powerful
  Agentless : it uses Openssh and winRM(windows)
  YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Languge , is a human -readable data serialization language.
  is a super set of JSON (YAML<->JSON)
  encrypt-decrypt(with Vault)
  Ansible gives some destruction also. so be careful.

Ansible installation:
*********************
Controller:
========
sudo su -
git clone https://github.com/lerndevops/labs
cd labs
cd cloud
./setup-user.sh                    # apt-get update;apt install dos2unix;dos2unix setup-user.sh

cd
cd labs/ansible/install
installAnsible.sh

ansible --version
cd /etc/ansible/
ls
ansible.cfg --> all ansible related settings will have in this file.
# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
host_key_checking = False

hosts --> is officially called as inventory file, where you will configure all node details.
## [webservers] --> you are grouping all below ip's/names
## alpha.example.org
## beta.example.org
## 192.168.1.100
## 192.168.1.110

roles:



Remote Nodes:
===========

sudo su -
git clone https://github.com/lerndevops/labs
cd labs
cd cloud
./setup-user.sh                    # apt-get update;apt install dos2unix;dos2unix setup-user.sh

-----------------
Ansible Commands:
-----------------
1. connect with user based authentication:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
user/pwd: devops/today@1234
root@master:~# ansible all -m ping -u devops -k
-vvvv : it will shows the command will show the backend execution to you.
root@master:~# ansible all -m ping -u devops -k -vvvv

2. connect with ssh(key) based authentication:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

it will sujected, all common user(devops) on all node machines.

ss-keygen --> to generate key and saves in /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa

public key: /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
private key: /home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa

perfered authentication is Password based authentication rather than SSH


Ansible Configurations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
do you need a good practice all ip add in host file?
no.so we will create our own inventory for your things.

create a ansible project folder. So, nobody will disturb it.
copy ansible.cfg
vi gouseinv <-- add your node ips under this gouseinv

vi ansible.cfg
[defaults]
# some basic default values...
inventory       = /root/gouse/gouseInv

command:
cd project directory
ansible -i gouseInv all -m ping -u devops -k

for not to ask for user/pass , when you run the ansible inventory command.
vi gouseInv
ansible_ssh_user=devops ansible_ssh_pass=today@1234

34.122.119.243 ansible_ssh_user=devops ansible_ssh_pass=today@1234
35.239.40.124 ansible_ssh_user=devops ansible_ssh_pass=today@1234

ansible -m ping
ansible -m ping PROD
ansible -m ping sit

How to run an adhok requests. onfly commands
ansible all -a "touch /tmp/ravifile"
to check from controler or above executed things.

ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/ravifile"

i want to a file under opt directory?
here /opt needs sudo privileges'. so you have to give the -b operational
ansible all -b -a "touch /opt/ravifile"
ansible all -b -a "ls -ltr /opt/ravifile"

ansible all -a "free -m" --limit 35.184.77.173

--limit : is used for limiting your execution, instead of all servers, we will test on limited servers. its a test.
 --limit , it a simulation, before for your final execution?

ansible all -m setup --> it will gives you all your nodes machines data.
ansible above commands shows, it collects FACTS( we can called this data as FACTS)

playbooks:(we use YAML language)--> is in the combination of Key value pair, List, Dict.
~~~~~~~~~~
officially: docs.ansible.com
its a opensource
and enterprise called as ansible tower.

example: to read facts of nodes
to overcome the adhoks commands issues, we are using playbooks.
ansible execution language is called a playbook.

YAML structure is a key value pair.
Key : value
Trainer : Ravi

when there is a plural, then List comes into this picture.

List

Participants:
  -max
  -harsh
  -vijay

Dict

Participants:
  -max
    exp: 10
    Cert: aka
  -harsh
    exp: 10
    Cert: aka
  -vijay
    exp: 10
    Cert: aka

ansible modules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

arround 3000 modules inorder to use ansible taks
-m is the module and "ping" is the module name.

lets create our first playbook.

vi copy.YAML or copy.yml
-hosts: all
 tasks:
    -name: copying a file
      copy:
        src: /tmp/testfile
        dest: /tmp/

root@master:~/gouse# touch /tmp/testfile
root@master:~/gouse# ansible-playbook copy.yaml

create a new file playbook:

- hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: create a file
      file:
       path: /tmp/testfile
       state: gouse

debug: --> is to print the values with msg:
syntax:
debug:
  msg: "{{item}}

create a new file with variables print.

- host: all
  var


Ansible role: 
for execution of the playbook successfully, ansible introduced a concept a "Ansible role"
its a prerequisite for the playbook execution.
it will come with a single package.

concepts:
Folders
calling jdk.yml in tomcat.yml
the main logic will be created as main.yml <- tomcat.yml
inputs artifacts in "files" folder
