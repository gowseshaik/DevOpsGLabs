Calling a REST API from django view
=====================================

import requests

def my_django_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        r = requests.post('https://www.somedomain.com/some/url/save', params=request.POST)
    else:
        r = requests.get('https://www.somedomain.com/some/url/save', params=request.GET)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        return HttpResponse('Yay, it worked')
    return HttpResponse('Could not save data')


Yes of course there is. You could use urllib2.urlopen but I prefer requests.

The requests library is a very simple API over the top of urllib3, everything you need to know about making a request using it can be found here.
