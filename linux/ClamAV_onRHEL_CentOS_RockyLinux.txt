I have used ClamAV on RHEL and CentOS installations.
You ‘should’ be able to use the same packages on the Rocky distribution…
Seek the ‘clamav’ packages at (or any of the other EPEL mirror sites):
https://dfw.mirror.rackspace.com/epel/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/c/

Remember, you’re only scanning for ‘Windows’-based files, and should limit the scans to areas where ‘users’ might deposit ‘Windows’ files onto the Linux system (ie. /tmp,/var/tmp/, HOME, etc)
