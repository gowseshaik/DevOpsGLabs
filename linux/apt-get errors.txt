solution:
=========

To resolve this error, you need to delete the troublesome PPA from your the repository on your system. To achieve this, launch the ‘Software and Updates’ tool as shown.

On the ‘Software & Updates‘ window, click on the ‘Other Software‘ tab. Next, click to uncheck and purge the problematic PPAs.

ex: our problematic PPA is: http://ppa.launchpad.net/videolan/stable-daily/ubuntu
so unxheck and close it, and next click on reload.

now check with "$ sudo apt-get udate", now it will work without an error.
