sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop

I had the same problem, and none of the solutions posted here worked.
What worked for me is the following:

     sudo apt-get upgrade
     sudo reboot
Commands such as apt-get update where not working before reboot. After rebooting I opened a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and updated everything

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
and everything seems to work fine.
