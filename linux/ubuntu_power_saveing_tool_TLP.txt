TLP works to save power and prevent overheating. It provides AMD Radeon GPU power management. It provides power management for CPU, GPU, WiFi, Bluetooth, HDD and more.

You can install TLP like so:

sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw
After installation run  sudo tlp start and reboot.

You will see longer battery life and reduced CPU / GPU heating after installation and reboot. However, it may take a few days to get the full effect of TLP.

TLP runs as a service. It is started from the terminal and it has no GUI.

After you install TLP, you run it for the first time using this command in the terminal:

sudo tlp start
Then you do not need to run it again. It will run automatically with each reboot.

You can check the status of the TLP service by running the following command in the terminal:

sudo systemctl status tlp.service
You will get an output like this:

‚óè tlp.service - TLP system startup/shutdown
