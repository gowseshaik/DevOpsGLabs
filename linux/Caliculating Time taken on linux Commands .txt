============== Time caliculation on your linux commands=============
The time command in Linux is used to determine the duration of execution of a command. This command is useful when you want to know the exection time of a command or a script. By default, three times are displayed:

real time – the total execution time. This is the time elapsed between invocation and termination of the command.
user CPU time – the CPU time used by your process.
system CPU time – the CPU time used by the system on behalf of your process.
